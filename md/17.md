What we are looking for is the `debounceTime` operator. Its marble
diagram can be found here:

And after inserting it, our code looks like this:

```js
const button = document.querySelector( '.my-button' );

const clickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent( button, 'click' );

const limitStream = clickStream.debounceTime( 1000 );

const urlStream = limitStream.map( (click) => 'http://some.domain.com/' );

const responseStream = limitStream.flatMap(
  (url) => Rx.Observable.fromPromise( $.ajax( url ) )
);

responseStream.subscribe( (response) => { /* do something */ } );
```
