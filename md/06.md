In the previous example we were only interested in the values, and in
this scenario there are no complications of the stream being
terminated or throwing an error.

But, adding those, we have the complete contract of an `Observer`:

```js
.subscribe(
    
  (value) => { /* onNext */ },
  
  (error) => { /* onError */ },
  
  () => { /* onCompleted */ }
  
);
```
