To get data out of an `Observable`, we must `subscribe` to it.

In fact, in most cases the stream will produce no values at all until
there is a subscription.

Let's start by creating an `Observable` which generates a value each
time a user clicks a button on a page.

```js
const button = document.querySelector( '.my-button' );

const clickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent( button, 'click' );

clickStream.subscribe( (click) => { console.log('click'); } );
```
