The example we've seen doesn't really do justice to the power of RX;
we could have achieved this result the old-fashioned way with callbacks

But it really is extremely powerful, if we make an effort to mentally
translate everything in terms of a single kind of object (streams) we'll
have available a comprehensive toolbox of operators on those objects.
