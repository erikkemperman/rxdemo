Fortunately, because `Promise`s can be treated as just a special kind
of `Observable`s, there are utilities for "promoting" them and things
look _almost_ right once more:

```js
const button = document.querySelector( '.my-button' );

const clickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent( button, 'click' );

const urlStream = clickStream.map( (click) => 'http://some.domain.com/' );

const responseMetaStream = urlStream.map(
  (url) => Rx.Observable.fromPromise( $.ajax( url ) )
);

// ?
```

We called the new stream `responseMetaStream` because what happens is that for
each click in the original stream, we now have a whole new stream. I.e.,
the end of our pipeline now emits a _stream of streams_.
