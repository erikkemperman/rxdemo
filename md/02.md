At the heart of RX is something called `Observable`, representing
a stream of values, optionally terminated by either a `completed` or an
`error` condition.


Getting started with RX basically involves thinking about almost everything
as a stream. It will feel like overkill in some cases at first, but you'll
quickly get the hang of it -- and once you do, it's actually very convenient
that you only have to think about one kind of object.
