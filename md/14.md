There are operators for virtually every reasonable scenario.

You _can_ write your own operators of course, but in most cases you'll
be repeating something which existed already (but maybe called something
you didn't expect) or else you're probably trying to do too many things
in a single stage of your pipeline and then you should consider using
multiple standard operators instead.

Lesson: Get to know the standard toolbox.
