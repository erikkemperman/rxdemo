Once a stream errors or completes (one or the other) there will
be no more values.

You may notice a similarity with `Promise`s, which also have separate
paths for regular completion, `then()`, and failure, `catch()`.

And indeed, as hinted by the matrix earlier, we can think of `Promise`s
as a special kind of `Observable` -- one that only ever emits a single
value rather than a stream of multiple values.
