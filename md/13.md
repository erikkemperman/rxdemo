I stole the previous image from the documentation for `RxJava`, one of
two main Java implementations (*).

These diagrams are so helpful in reasoning about operators that the
`RxJava` project includes them within their JavaDocs!

Another great resource is available at RxMarbles.com, where the
diagrams are interactive:

(*) The other is Reactor, developed for Spring 5.
