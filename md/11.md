The `map` operator might remind you of the method on `Array.prototype`
of the same name. And yes, it does the same thing on values in a stream
that its analogue does for the elements in an array.

Likewise, there are analogues for things like `reduce`, `elementAt`
and so on.

But there are also many operators that are particular to `Observable`s.
For one thing, a stream might well be infinite (never complete)!
