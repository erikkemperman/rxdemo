So, that's the essence of it.

But using RX in production requires a bit of infrastructure... Things like logging,
debugging and unit-testing become slightly more involved. Frameworks should help,
but sometimes you just want a quick and dirty hack to see, e.g. if values mid-way
your pipeline are what you expect.

Using `map` you can always insert something like this, temporarily:

```js

myStream.map( (value) => {
  console.log('Is this the right value?', value);
  return value;
} );
```
