All of the various language-specific implementations of RX share the
same (or at least nearly the same) API for `Observable`s -- along with
a battery of _operators_ which we can use to create, combine, or
transform processing pipelines into composite streams.

All of which produces things that are themselves also `Observable`s,
meaning we can chain them together nicely.
