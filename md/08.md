Going further along this path, let's use the click event to trigger
an AJAX call, and then pass along the resulting value further down
the stream.

```js
const button = document.querySelector( '.my-button' );

const clickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent( button, 'click' );

const urlStream = clickStream.map( (click) => 'http://some.domain.com/' );

urlStream.subscribe(
  (url) => {
    const responseStream = Rx.Observable.create(
      (observer) => {
        $.ajax( url )
        .then( (response) => { observer.next(response); } )
        .catch( (error) => { observer.error(error); } )
        .finally( () => { observer.complete(); } );
      }
    );

    responseStream.subscribe( (response) => { /* do something */ } );
  }
);
```

Notice the nested `subscribe`... Remind you of callback hell? But that
was what `Promise`s were supposed to help us get out of!
