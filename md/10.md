What we need here, instead of the `map` operator, is `flatMap`. As the
name suggests, it flattens this extra layer and we are left with a
pipeline that emits a single AJAX response for each click.


```js
const button = document.querySelector( '.my-button' );

const clickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent( button, 'click' );

const urlStream = clickStream.map( (click) => 'http://some.domain.com/' );

const responseStream = urlStream.flatMap(
  (url) => Rx.Observable.fromPromise( $.ajax( url ) )
);

responseStream.subscribe( (response) => { /* do something */ } );
```
