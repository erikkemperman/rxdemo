Suppose for example we want to rate-limit the AJAX requests. No matter
how often the user clicks our button, we never want to do more than a
single AJAX request per second.

Doing things the old-fashioned way, this would require us to keep
various bits of state around, and it would involve timers of some sort.

Instead, with RX, we find that there is a ready-made operator that
does precisely what we want!

And because we only deal with one kind of object, we can simply insert
this operator into our pipeline with little regard to what comes before
or after it.
